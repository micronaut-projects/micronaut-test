Let's take a look at an example using JUnit 5. Consider you have the following interface:

.The MathService Interface
[source,java]
----
include::{junit5tests}/MathService.java[]
----

And a simple implementation that computes the value times 4 and is defined as a Micronaut bean:

.The MathService implementation
[source,java]
----
include::{junit5tests}/MathServiceImpl.java[]
----

You can define the following test to test the implementation:

.The MathService specification
[source,groovy]
----
include::{junit5tests}/MathServiceTest.java[]
----

<1> The test is declared as Micronaut test with `@MicronautTest`
<2> The `@Inject` annotation is used to inject the bean
<3> The test itself tests the injected bean
