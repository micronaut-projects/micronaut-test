You can write integration tests that test external servers in a couple of different ways.

One way is with the `micronaut.test.server.executable` property that allows you to specify the location of an executable JAR or native image of a server that should be started and shutdown for the lifecycle of test.

In this case Micronaut Test will replace the regular server with an instance of api:test.support.server.TestExecutableEmbeddedServer[] that executes the process to start the server and closes the process when the test ends.

For example:

.Using `micronaut.test.server.executable`
[source,java]
----
include::{junit5tests}/server/ProcessServerTest.java[tags="executable"]
----

Alternatively if you have independently started an `EmbeddedServer` instance programmatically you can also specify the URL to the server with the `micronaut.test.server.url` property.
