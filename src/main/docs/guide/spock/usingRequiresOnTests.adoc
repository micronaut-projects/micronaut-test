Since `@MicronautTest` turns tests into beans themselves, it means you can use the `@Requires` annotation on the test to enable/disable tests. For example:

[source,java]
----
@MicronautTest
@Requires(env = "my-env")
class RequiresSpec extends Specification {
    ...
}
----

The above test will only run if `my-env` is active (you can activate it by passing the system property `micronaut.environments`).
