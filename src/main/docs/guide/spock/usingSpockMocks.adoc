Now let's say you want to replace the implementation with a Spock Mock. You can do so by defining a method that returns a Spock mock and is annotated with `@MockBean`, for example:

.The MathService specification
[source,groovy]
----
include::{spocktests}/MathMockServiceSpec.groovy[]
----

<1> The `@MockBean` annotation is used to indicate the method returns a mock bean. The value to the method is the type being replaced.
<2> Spock's `Mock(..)` method creates the actual mock
<3> The Mock is injected into the test
<4> Spock is used to verify the mock is called
