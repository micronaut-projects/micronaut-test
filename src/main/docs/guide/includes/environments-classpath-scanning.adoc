The `@MicronautTest` annotation supports specifying the environment names the test should run with:

```java
@MicronautTest(environments={"foo", "bar"})
```

In addition, although Micronaut itself doesn't scan the classpath, some integrations do (such as JPA and GORM), for these cases you may wish to specify either the application class:

```java
@MicronautTest(application=Application.class)
```

Or the packages:

```java
@MicronautTest(packages="foo.bar")
```

To ensure that entities can be found during classpath scanning.
