When using `@MicronautTest` each `@Test` method will be wrapped in a transaction that will be rolled back when the test finishes. This behaviour can be changed by using the `transactional` and `rollback` properties.

To avoid creating a transaction:

```java
@MicronautTest(transactional = false)
```

To not rollback the transaction:

```java
@MicronautTest(rollback = false)
```

Additionally, the `transactionMode` property can be used to further customize the way that transactions are handled for
each test:

```java
@MicronautTest(transactionMode = TransactionMode.SINGLE_TRANSACTION)
```

The following transaction modes are supported:

* `SEPARATE_TRANSACTIONS` (default) - Each setup/cleanup method is wrapped in its own transaction, separate from that of
  the test. This transaction is always committed.
* `SINGLE_TRANSACTION` - All setup methods are wrapped in the same transaction as the test. Cleanup methods are wrapped
  in separate transactions.

NOTE: Setup and cleanup methods are not wrapped in transactions in Kotest currently. As a result, transaction modes have
no effect in Kotest.
